## Development

Glitch is recommended:

1. [![Remix on Glitch](https://cdn.glitch.com/2703baf2-b643-4da7-ab91-7ee2a2d00b5b%2Fremix-button.svg)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/import/github/EQWorks/ws-product-python)
2. Populate `.env` file with the environment variables given in the problem set we send to you through email
3. Click on `Show Live` and you should see `Welcome to EQ Works ðŸ˜Ž`

You can also opt to develop using your local environment. Python 3.6+ is recommended.

## Notes on working through the problems

Make sure any additional Python level dependencies are properly added in `Pipfile`. We encourage a healthy mixture of your own implementations, and good choices of existing open-source libraries/tools. We will comment in the problems to indicate which ones cannot be solved purely through an off-the-shelf solution.
