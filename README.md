### Notes on working through the problems

Make sure any additional Python level dependencies are properly added in `Pipfile`. We encourage a healthy mixture of your own implementations, and good choices of existing open-source libraries/tools. We will comment in the problems to indicate which ones cannot be solved purely through an off-the-shelf solution.
